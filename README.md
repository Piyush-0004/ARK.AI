# ARKAI – AI Chat Application

A full-stack AI chatbot built using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and the OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API. It enables real-time, dynamic conversations with an intelligent assistant that can answer questions, generate code, solve problems, and provide helpful insights—just like ChatGPT.

 - Smart Chat Interface – Clean and modern UI built with React for smooth user experience.

 - GPT-4o-mini Integration – Leverages OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini model to deliver fast and intelligent responses.

 - Persistent Threads – Conversations are saved in MongoDB, allowing users to view and continue old chats.

 - MongoDB Integration – Stores chat history, thread metadata, and user inputs in a scalable NoSQL database.

 - Developer-Friendly – GPT-4o-mini can write code, debug errors, answer technical queries, and more.

 - Deployed on Render – Fully hosted backend and frontend with separate services, integrated via environment variables.
